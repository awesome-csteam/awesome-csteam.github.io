            <p>ABSTRACT:
              Many malicious behavior detection approaches rely on dynamic features
              that are extracted from Application Programming Interfaces
              (APIs), which represent the run-time behavior of programs. Most
              API-based malicious behavior detection techniques highly focus on
              measuring the statistical features of API calls such as finding the
              frequency (e.g., how many times a specific API is called) or recognizing
              the sequence pattern of API calls. However, such detectors
              can be easily evaded and bypassed by malware authors who would
              interrupt the sequence by basically hooking and shufiing the API
              calls or deleting/inserting the irrelevant calls. Also, most proposed
              API-based malicious behavior detectors would either consider only
              the API calls (e.g., function names) without taking into account
              their arguments information (e.g., function parameters) or incur
              a prohibitive cost, such as requiring complex operations to deal
              with the arguments (e.g., proficient knowledge about the types of
              the arguments and/or powerful computers to extract them). As
              relying on API calls alone is insuficient to understand the purpose
              of the program, we propose a low-cost malicious behavior detection
              approach that can extract APIs dynamic features by studying the
              API calls together with their arguments using machine learning.
              Experimental results show that our approach achieves an accuracy
              of over 98.24% with two difierent datasets, and outperforms the
              state-of-the-art malicious behavior detection techniques.</p>

            <p>ABSTRACT: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are still considered the standard accessible data source and core wok of the most widely
adopted malware detection and classification techniques. API-based malware detectors highly rely on measuring API’s statistical features, such as calculating the frequency counter of calling specific
API calls or finding their malicious sequence pattern (i.e., signaturebased detectors). Using simple hooking tools, malware authors
would help in failing such detectors by interrupting the sequence and shuffling the API calls or deleting/inserting irrelevant calls
(i.e., changing the frequency counter). Moreover, relying on API calls (e.g., function names) alone without taking into account their
function parameters is insufficient to understand the purpose of the program. For example, the same API call (e.g., writing on a
file) would act in two ways if two different arguments are passed (e.g., writing on a system versus user file). However, because of the
heterogeneous nature of API arguments, most of the available APIbased malicious behavior detectors would consider only the API
calls without taking into account their argument information (e.g., function parameters). Alternatively, other detectors try considering the API arguments in their techniques, but they acquire having proficient knowledge about the API arguments or powerful processors
to extract them. Such requirements demand a prohibitive cost and complex operations to deal with the arguments. To overcome the
above limitations, with the help of machine learning and without any expert knowledge of the arguments, we propose a light-weight
API-based dynamic feature extraction technique, and we use it to implement a malware detection and type classification approach.
To evaluate our approach, we use reasonable datasets of 7774 benign and 7105 malicious samples belonging to ten distinct malware
types. Experimental results show that our type classification module could achieve an accuracy of 98.0253 %, where our malware
detection module could reach an accuracy of over 99.8992 %, and
outperforms many state-of-the-art API-based malware detectors.</p>
